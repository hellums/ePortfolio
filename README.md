# ePortfolio

This program uses Blazor WebAssembly to create a personal ePortfolio of pages and components representing my body of software development work (professional, academic, and personal). This ePortfolio constitutes a wrapper for a deliverable project (a Baker's Percentage Engine) that is part of a Code Louisville bootcamp on C# and object-oriented programming. It includes work from additional bootcamps on Python and Data Analysis, and will remain as a living document, app, and repository with its own SDLC.

## Why Blazor?

Blazor was chosen because it has several advantages for a project like this:
- A Blazor ePortfolio serves a valid business need for me personally
- A Blazor ePortfolio can be delivered from anywhere, including CDNs, without the need for a complicated backend stack
- A Blazor ePortfolio and the embedded C# project satisfy the course requirements of the bootcamp
- A Blazor ePortfolio is a more user-friendly interface, as an SPA, (with less "noise") than Github
- The ePortfolio can easily be decoupled from Github
- A Blazor app profides a Full Stack open web development framework for C# (vs Javascript's Angular, Vue, and React, or Python's Django/Flask)
- A Blazor app is new and fresh, from a technology and software development perspective
- A Blazor app leverages the newest WebAssembly (Wasm) standard, as well as fundamental HTML, CSS, and Javascript
