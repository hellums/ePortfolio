# ePortfolio

This program uses Blazor WebAssembly to create a personal ePortfolio of Razor pages and components representing my body of software development work (professional, academic, and personal). This ePortfolio constitutes a wrapper for at least one deliverable project (a Baker's Percentage Engine) that is part of a Code Louisville bootcamp on C#, .NET, and object-oriented programming. It includes work from additional bootcamps on Python and Data Analysis, and will remain as a living document, app, and repository with its own SDLC.

## Why Blazor?

I chose Blazor because it has several purported advantages for a project like this:
- Blazor leverages the newest WebAssembly (Wasm) standard, as well as fundamental HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Open Iconic, and Javascript
- Blazor provides a Full Stack open web development framework for C# (vs Javascript's Angular, Vue, and React, or Python's Django/Flask)
- Blazor is new and fresh and shiny, from a technology and software development perspective
- A Blazor ePortfolio and the underlying C# project satisfy the course requirements of the bootcamp
- A Blazor ePortfolio serves a valid business need for me personally
- A Blazor ePortfolio can be delivered from anywhere, including CDNs, without the need for a complicated backend stack
- A Blazor ePortfolio is easily deployed from Visual Studio to an Azure hosted app where anyone can download it on any device
- A Blazor ePortfolio can be integrated with a CI/CD pipeline to Azure
- A Blazor ePortfolio can easily be decoupled from Github or a .NET server
- A Blazor ePortfolio is a more user-friendly interface, as an SPA, (with less "noise") than Github (especially for an ePortfolio)
