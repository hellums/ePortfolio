<h1><span class="oi oi-globe"></span> Hello Again, World!</h1>
<hr />
<h3><span class="oi oi-heart"></span> My Passion for Coding</h3>
<p>Coding was one of my true "first loves" in school, life, and career. My introduction to monolithic, functional programming was on a ridiculously expensive Apple IIe and then a sadly much cheaper Texas Instruments TI-99/4A (oddly <a target="_blank" href="https://wilwheaton.net/2015/09/hello-world/">Wil Wheaton's favorite</a> also).</p>
<p>As the market for home computers improved, I moved on to modular, procedural programming of PCs in Turbo Pascal and C, on the Tandy 1000HX and a 486SX IBM PC.</p>
<p>I programmed in C/C++, Turbo Pascal, 3rd party GUI DLL on SCO Linux, and Assembly language on a clustered pair of Burroughs B6x00/7x00 mainframes. Each of those had a PC emulator that replaced their vintage terminal, punch card reader, and 14-inch Winchester disks. </p>

<h3><span class="oi oi-code"></span> My "Return to the Matrix"</h3>
<p>They say if you do what you love, you'll never work a day in your life. And I've always loved writing, debugging, and testing software.</p>
<p>So, when my wife (my other love, back then in school and now) recently resigned her position as Admissions Manager for some well-deserved time off, I decided to step out of my role as Director of IT (Infrastructure & Operations) also, and join her for a 1-year "Back to School" career break/sabbatical and some travel.</p>
<p>I was eager to refresh my degree and boost my web, Agile, and object-oriented knowledge and skillset. So, I broke out all my programming books, downloaded Visual Studio Code, and hit the Web!</p>
<p>I soon learned about <a target="_blank" href="https://codelouisville.org">Code Louisville</a> and decided to take some of their Pluralsight video-based, mentor-facilitated classes. This included instruction or use of the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>.NET 6/Core, C#, Python, OOP</li>
    <li>Data Analysis/Visualization, Jupyter Notebook, MatPlotLib</li>
    <li>IDEs, Visual Studio and VS Code, IDLE</li>
    <li>HTML, CSS, Bootstrap</li>
    <li>Web frameworks (Razor, Blazor/Wasm, Flask/Jinja2)</li>
    <li>Agile, Kanban</li>
    <li>Object-oriented SW design principles and patterns (SOLID, DRY, DI)</li>
    <li>SW architecture patterns (N-Tier, REST API, MVVM, MVC)</li>
    <li>SaaS (Git, Slack, Google Colab)</li>
    <li>PaaS (Azure websites, Docker containers)</li>
    <li>DevOps, CI/CD pipelines (software, data)</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="oi oi-person"></span> My Early Years</h3>
<p>Although I've lived in Kentucky for 20 years now, I was born and raised in Texas. My stepdad's oil drilling job took us to Spain, where I learned to program in my High School's first programming class. </p>
<p>When I wasn't in the computer lab, I was writing out code by hand or desk-checking printouts, even on camping trips with my future wife. I planned to go to college and get a Computer Science degree after graduation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, and with virtually no notice, the government took away the scholarship they had promised my veteran father his kids would receive. So college wasn't in my immediate future.</p>

<h3><span class="oi oi-headphones"></span> My Enlisted Days</h3>
<p>Unlike my dad, who enlisted in the Army at 13, I decided to join the Air Force at 18 and "see the world," or at least more of it. The Air Force recruiter sent me to Dallas to take the computer aptitude test, but they slyly rooked me into taking the foreign language test instead, since I already knew Spanish. Can't trust recruiters!</p>
<p>Long story short, while I was in basic training (boot camp) to become a Russian linguist, I received my acceptance letter to the University of New Hampshire. Irony. But soon I would be able say "Здравствуй, Mир" as well as "Hola, Mundo!"</p>

<h3><span class="oi oi-dollar"></span> My "Night School" (and Weekends)</h3>
<p>Over the next 6 years I took a plethora of general education and basic computing classes, until I could become a computer science major in earnest. Luckily, we used computers and databases as linguists, so I found many programming projects and eventually part-time and full-time system administrator duties.</p>

<h3><span class="oi oi-tags"></span> My Officer Days</h3> 
<p>After completing my Bachelor's in Europe and Master's degree in the Pacific, I traded in my Master Sergeant stripes for a "gold bar" with a commission to become a software developer for the next 5 years. I loved coding, and a promotion to Captain steered me into Software Project Management and eventually teaching ROTC at University of Kentucky.</p>

<h3><span class="oi oi-cog"></span> My Path in "Higher Ed"</h3>
<p>Transitioning from the military, I had a lock on a Commonwealth Office of Technology position, but it was put on "indefinite hold" thanks to "Forgy v. Stumbo."</p>
<p>I waited a short while, but eventually opted to take a college Operations position managing Linux and Windows servers, applications, websites, databases, and email, and eventually the network equipment also.</p>
<p>I've since led several college IT Operations and Support teams, and mastered my skills (and theirs) building out and administering enterprise applications and infrastructure.</p>
<p>And that's essentially me, in a nutshell!</p>
