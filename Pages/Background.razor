<h1><span class="oi oi-globe"></span> Hello Again, World!</h1>
<hr />

<h3><span class="oi oi-code"></span> My Roots</h3>
<p>I've lived in Kentucky for 20 years now, but was born and raised in Texas, before moving to Spain and taking my first programming class ("Hola, Mundo").</p> 

<h3><span class="oi oi-tags"></span> My Officer "Dev" Years</h3>
<p>While working on my computer information systems degree(s), I wrote console programs, tools, and utilities as a system administrator. Then I graduated and became lead software developer, configuration manager, and eventually PM of the 12-member team maintaining a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/systems/direct.htm">nuclear command and control (messaging) system</a> used by the Joint Staff and nuclear commanders.</p>
<p>For 4 years I was responsible for the SDLC and semi-annual development, version control, build/make, test (unit, system, integration, IV&V, UA), distribution, release, and maintenance/support of the C/C++ Unix desktop and Burroughs mainframe software and satellite communications interface.</p>

<h3><span class="oi oi-cog"></span> My Higher Education "Ops" Years</h3>
<p>I worked at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.georgetowncollege.edu/">Georgetown College</a> as a system administrator of Linux and Windows servers, applications, websites, databases, email, and eventually the entire network.</p>
<p>I was recruited from there to <a target="_blank" href="https://galencollege.edu/">Galen College of Nursing</a>, where I led and grew the engineering and support team from 6 to 17, while building out networks, IT, and interactive classrooms on 8 new campuses, and virtualizing servers and applications in our hybrid cloud, network, and telecomm (VOIP and SDWAN).</p>
