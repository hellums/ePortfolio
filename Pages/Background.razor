<h1><span class="oi oi-globe"></span> Hello Again, World!</h1>
<hr />

<h3><span class="oi oi-person"></span> My Early Years</h3>
<p>Although I've lived in Kentucky for 20 years now, I was born and raised in Texas. My stepdad's oil drilling job took us to Spain, where I learned to program in my High School's first programming class. </p>
<p>When I wasn't in the computer lab, I was writing out code by hand or desk-checking printouts. I planned to go to college and get a Computer Science degree after graduation. Unfortunately, the government took away the scholarship they had promised my veteran father his kids would receive, with virtually no notice.</p>

<h3><span class="oi oi-headphones"></span> My Enlisted Days</h3>
<p>I decided to join the military and "see the world" (or at least more of it). The Air Force sent me to Dallas to take the computer aptitude test, but they slyly rooked me into taking the foreign language test instead, since I knew Spanish already. Can't trust recruiters!</p>
<p>Long story short, while I was in basic training (boot camp) to become a Russian linguist, I received my acceptance letter to the University of New Hampshire. Irony. But soon I would be able say "Здравствуй, Mир" as well as "Hola, Mundo!"</p>

<h3><span class="oi oi-dollar"></span> My "Night School" (and Weekends)</h3>
<p>Over the next 6 years I took a plethora of general education and basic computing classes in the evenings, until I could become a computer science major in earnest. Luckily, we used computers as linguists, so I was also able to carve out some programming projects and eventually part-time and full-time system administrator duties.</p>

<h3><span class="oi oi-tags"></span> My Officer Days</h3> 
<p>After completing my Bachelor's in Europe and Master's degree in the Pacific, I finally got back on track, earning a commission to be a software developer for the next 5 years. Promotions steered me into Project Management and eventually teaching ROTC at University of Kentucky. </p>

<h3><span class="oi oi-cog"></span> My Path in "Higher Ed"</h3>
<p>I had a great software department leadership position lined up at the Commonwealth Office of Technology, but that got put on "indefinite hold" unfortunately, due to "Forgy v. Stumbo" even though I was slotted for a "non-merit" position. C'est la vie!</p>
<p>I instead took an Operations position managing Linux and Windows servers, databases, websites, and email, and eventually the network equipment also. This led to countless growth and learning opportunities, and I continued to lead IT operations teams and master my skills (and theirs) building out and administering applications and the infrastructure it needs to thrive.</p>
<p>And that's me, in a nutshell!</p>
