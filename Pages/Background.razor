<h1><span class="oi oi-globe"></span> Hello Again, World!</h1>
<hr />

<h3><span class="oi oi-code"></span> My Roots</h3>
<p>I've lived in Kentucky for 20 years now, but was born and raised in Texas. Ended up in Spain, where I learned to program in my High School's first programming class ("Hola, Mundo"). Then came enlistment in the Air Force and college. As a linguist ("Здравствуй, Mир") I applied my skills to writing domain-specific (military intelligence) tools, utilities, and applications, before becoming a full-time system administrator and lead.</p>

    <h3><span class="oi oi-tags"></span> My Officer Days</h3>
<p>After finishing my BA and MSIS, I worked for 4 years on a 12-member team as an Air Force lead software developer, configuration manager, and PM, handling the SDLC and semi-annual development, version control, build/make, test (unit, system, integration, IV&V, UA), distribution, release, and maintenance/support of C/C++ Unix desktop and mainframe software for a nuclear command and control (messaging) system for the Joint Staff and nuclear commanders. If you saw the movie Crimson Tide, this is the system that created and transmitted the "EAMs" you saw the submarine Captains receiving and decoding. I also created the first enterprise LMS for the Air Force, and taught ROTC at UK.</p>

<h3><span class="oi oi-cog"></span> My "Return to the Matrix"</h3>
<p>I worked operations at Georgetown College as a system administrator of Linux and Windows servers, applications, websites, databases, email, and eventually the entire network.</p>
<p>I was recruited from there to Galen College of Nursing, where I continuously improved Operations and led, mentored, and grew the team from 6 to 17, while building out networks and IT on 8 new campuses and virtualizing storage and compute for applications in our data center, as well as our network and phone services (SDWAN and VOIP).</p>
