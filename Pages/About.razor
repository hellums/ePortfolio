<h3><span class="oi oi-code"></span> My Fondness for Code</h3>
<p>My introduction to programming was on a ridiculously expensive Apple IIe and a sadly much cheaper Texas Instruments TI-99/4A (oddly Wil Wheaton's' <a target="_blank" href="https://wilwheaton.net/2015/09/hello-world/">favorite</a> also).</p>
<p>As the market for home computers improved, I moved on to programming PCs in Turbo Pascal and C, on the Tandy 1000HX and a 486SX IBM PC.</p>
<p>I programmed in Assembly language on a pair of Burroughs B6x00/7x00 mainframes and a PC emulator that replaced their vintage punch card readers and 10" Winchester disks. But the job was mostly C/C++, Turbo Pascal, and 3rd party GUI DLL work on SCO Linux.</p>

<h3><span class="oi oi-heart"></span> My Return to Software Development</h3>
<p>Coding was one of my true "first loves" in school, life, and career. When my wife (my other love, then and now) recently resigned her position as Admissions Manager for some well-deserved time off,
    I saw a good opportunity to step out of my role as Director of IT (Infrastructure & Operations) and join her for a 1-year career break/sabbatical. 
    I wanted to refresh my degree somewhat, so I broke out all my programming books and downloaded Visual Studio Code. </p>
<p>I soon learned about <a target="_blank" href="https://codelouisville.org">Code Louisville</a> and decided to take some of their Pluralsight video-based and mentor-facilitated classes. 
    This included .NET and C#, Python, OOP, and Data Analysis courses using VS, VSC, and Jupyter Notebook, with the requisite study of several collaboratiion and Web programming languages and frameworks (Slack, Git, Azure, Razor, Blazor, Flask/Jinja2, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Google Colab).</p>
    <p>Samples of my work are highlighted in the nav bar, along with links on the menu bar to my LinkedIn and GitHub pages.</p>
